    "Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) compares the costs and effectiveness of treatments across a set of mutually exclusive strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to order strategies by increasing costs. As costs increase, effectiveness should also increase. Any strategy with lower effectiveness but higher costs than another strategy is said to be <b>dominated</b>. A rational decision-maker would never implement a dominated strategy because greater effectiveness could be achieved at lower cost by implementing a different strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the incremental cost and incremental effectiveness of moving from one strategy to the next (in order of increasing costs) are calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (<b>ICER</b>) for each strategy is then its incremental costs divided by its incremental effectiveness: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "ICER_{A,B} = \\frac{C_A - C_B}{E_A - E_B}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ICER represents the cost per unit benefit of “upgrading” to that strategy from the next least costly (and next least effective) strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Weakly dominated</b> strategies are strategies for which there is a linear combination of two different strategies that dominates the strategy (lower costs and/or higher effectiveness). Weak dominance is also called “extended dominance”. Operationally, weakly dominated strategies can be identified by checking that ICERs increase with increasingly costly (and effective) strategies. If there is a “kink” in the trend, then weak/extended dominance exists. Once weakly dominated strategies are removed (and incremental quantities recalculated), the set of remaining strategies form the efficient frontier and associated ICERs can be interpreted for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dampack function `calculate_icers()` completes all of the calculations and checks described above. It takes as inputs the cost, effectiveness outcome (usually QALYs), and strategy name for each strategy, passed as separate vectors. It outputs a specialized data frame that presents the costs and effectiveness of each strategy and, for non-dominated strategies, the incremental costs, effectiveness, and ICER. Dominated strategies are included at the end of the table with the type of dominance indicated as either strong dominance (D) or extended/weak dominance (ED) in the Status column.\n",
